/**
 * Internal: shared bootstrap + auto-persist machinery for the prefs
 * scope roots.
 *
 * Lives in `composables/_internal/` so Nuxt's auto-import scan
 * (configured in `nuxt.config.ts` `imports:dirs` hook) skips it. The
 * public surface is the four typed composables
 * (`useAppPrefs`, `useGlobalPrefs`, `useAppFeaturePrefs`,
 * `useGlobalFeaturePrefs`) plus their `*PrefsRoot()` introspection
 * companions and the `flushPendingWrites` escape hatch (re-exported
 * from `composables/flushPendingWrites.ts` for auto-import).
 *
 * **Enforcement is type-level, not build-level.** A bare reference
 * to `seedFeatureDefaults(...)` in a tenant component will trip
 * `nuxi typecheck` (`TS2304: Cannot find name`) and IDE squiggles,
 * but `nuxt build` does NOT run typecheck by default and will
 * compile the bad reference into a `ReferenceError` at runtime. The
 * matching guidance for tenants is `skills/aether/pref.md`
 * §"Architecture and rationale" — wire `nuxi typecheck` into CI if
 * you want a build-time guarantee. The `_internal/` subdirectory
 * placement is the strongest enforcement we have without
 * mandating typecheck-in-build for every tenant app.
 *
 * Each scope (`'app'`, `'global'`) gets exactly one root reactive
 * object per session. The root holds the user's full prefs JSON for
 * that scope; mutations are deep-watched, debounced (150 ms), and
 * persisted as a whole-doc replacement.
 *
 * Why one-doc-per-user-per-scope: see `docs/BC_2_PREFS_API.md` in
 * the broadchurch repo. TL;DR — Vercel-KV-shaped simplicity on top
 * of per-tenant Firestore, no path math, no segment-parity bugs.
 *
 * Why whole-doc replacement instead of field-path merges:
 * single-tab single-session writes don't have concurrency to worry
 * about, and prefs payloads are KB-scale. We'll switch to field-path
 * merges when real-time multi-device sync lands (deferred).
